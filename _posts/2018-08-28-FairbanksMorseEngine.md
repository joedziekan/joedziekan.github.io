**Overview**

I worked in the Research and Development department on projects directly related to the [Trident Opposed Piston Engine](https://www.fairbanksmorse.com/trident-op). These projects consisted of conducting a failure analysis of an emissions testing probe before redesigning it, speeding up the startup of the engine, and creating a piston assembly cart to help technicians put in and take out pistons.

*Situation*

Prior to my internship at Fairbanks Morse Engine, an engineer designed an emissions probe to sample the exhaust gases leaving the 12 cylinders featured on the Trident opposed piston engine. Once installed, the engine was ran and each of the twelve probes sheared off due to unknown reasons at the time.

*Task*

I needed to conduct a failure analysis of the probe to determine the cause of the failure and redesign this probe to maintain structural integrity.
