**Machining**

*Avionics Bay*

I used a dremel tool and fast reacting epoxy to machine and assemble the avionics bay. This mounting fixture was machined within tolerance to allow a tight fit into the rocket's body.

*Wind Tunnel Testing Fixture Rod*

As seen in the main image, the rocket was mounted on a rod with bearings to allow the rocket to roll as the fins are deflected. I turned this rod down to tolerance on a lathe to snuggly fit the ball bearings, allowing accurate testing data to be collected.
