**Overview**

I worked in the Research and Development department on projects directly related to the [Trident Opposed Piston Engine](https://www.fairbanksmorse.com/trident-op). These projects consisted of conducting a failure analysis of an emissions testing probe before redesigning it, speeding up the startup of the engine, and creating a piston assembly cart to help technicians put in and take out pistons.

**Analysis of Lubrication Oil System for possible redesign**

*Situation*

The engine startup time (190 seconds) is limited by the pressure experienced by the lubrication oil pump. The lubrication oil is thicker at the heater temperature initially so the engine needs more time to warm up the oil to decrease its viscosity. However, the pressure limit is in place to prevent the lubrication oil idler shaft (as seen below) from shearing due to immense stress. There has been a history of failures in these shafts and the Research and Development team at FME wanted to know if the shaft can be pushed past the pressure limits put in place without failing in order to achieve an engine startup time of 30 seconds.

*Task*

 I was tasked with investigating these failures and analyzing the possible failure in the lubrication oil system with our given testing conditions.

*Action*

I began with an analysis of the idler shaft during power transmission to determine the boundary conditions caused when the engine was running. The shaft was conceptualized to undergo consisted loading once the engine was idling.
