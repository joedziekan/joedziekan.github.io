I'm a junior mechanical engineering student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who looks to pursue a career in aerospace. I am currently working as a fluid testing intern and at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida. I am responsible for evacuation and leak testing for the Restore-L project where a robotic payload will be launched to rendezvous with a satellite in low earth orbit to replenish the propellant on the satellite.

I joined NASA in August 2018 after completing sophomore year of my engineering bachelor's degree. I have served a role on a high powered rocketry team as a machinist for the AIAA chapter at UW-Madison. I helped machine the avionics bay, a rod for our wind tunnel fixture, and draft a SolidWorks assembly for the mounting of our servomechanisms on our centering ring.

Currently, I am working on creating a Mars autonomous methane synthesis plant to launch as the payload in the 2018-2019 Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition.
